This file traces through the flow through which I went to build
Phase 1:
    Infrastructure:
        a) Ant based build environment (DONE)
        b) Logging setup (DONE)
            Sunday pipeline
        c) Change of plans use sockets.
            i) Create client server Socket connection (Done)
        d) Database Driver (DONE)
           Run DataStax Server.
           Working somewhat but need to add JAR.
           Clean up complete build environment and ant
           (DONE)
        e) Clean up an deploy (BREAK)

Phase 2:
    Actual problem of algorithms
    a) Server side consistency
        a) Build one client and one server with updates flowing through.(start 2:00pm)
            0) Query flows from client to host (DONE)
            i) One DB node is working (Working 3:24)
        Day-1// bunking work make it count.
        Ideally finish the whole project
        a) Setup and validate single client server model(DONE)
        b) Create 2 Nodes
        c) Deploy server nodes
            The whole thing will get cleared in your head as you code up.
            Code up whole multicast algorithm, dont think on other components.
            Test multicast with 3 nodes. with 1 and 3 simultaneously sending
            Wrote Code for Server Side Consistency.
    Done
        Test ServerSide Consistency.
        Built Code to reuse port (DONE)
        case 1: Single Node Update (Start:2:35)
        case 2: 2 node concurrency resolution (DONE)
        case 3: 3 node with 2 node concurrency
        case 4: pending accept Pipeline DONE
    TODO
    Go Rapid coding mode
    b) Client Side consistency
        Review Code and Test it for all combinations
        (Start:5:00 pm)
        1) Setup Database:(DONE)
        2) Tests to perform
            a) Server centric consistency
            b) monotonic read
            c) monotonic write
            d) read follows writes

Project Complete :eat sushi

Some important commands
a) Run this first to install run time dependecies to lib
        mvn dependency:copy-dependencies -DoutputDirectory=lib
b) Cassandra first node
   create keyspace
        CREATE KEYSPACE Excelsior
          WITH REPLICATION = { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 3 };
c) running server with args1
      ant run-server -Dnode_id=1
      ${#process}
d) Some important commands for testing
   12345:localhost "insert into table1(id,col1) values (10,'seven');"
   12347:localhost "insert into table1(id,col1) values (11,'eight');"
   12345:localhost "select * from table1;"
