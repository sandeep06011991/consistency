Phase 1:
    Infrastructure:
a) Ant based build environment (DONE)
b) Logging setup (DONE)
    Sunday pipeline
c) Change of plans use sockets.
   i) Create client server Socket connection (Done)
d) Database Driver (Working)
   Run DataStax Server.
   Working somewhat but need to add JAR.
   Clean up complete build environment and ant
   (DONE)
e) Clean up an deploy (BREAK)

Phase 2:
    Actual problem of algorithms
    a) Server side consistency
        a) Build one client and one server with updates flowing through.(start 2:00pm)
            0) Query flows from client to host (DONE)
            i) One DB node is working (Working 3:24)
        Day-1// bunking work make it count.
        Ideally finish the whole project
        a) Setup and validate single client server model(DONE)
        b) Create 2 Nodes
        c) Deploy server nodes
        The whole thing will get cleared in your head as you code up.
        Code up whole multicast algorithm, dont think on other components.
        Test multicast with 3 nodes. with 1 and 3 simultaneously sending
        Wrote Code for Server Side Consistency.
    TODO:
        Test ServerSide Consistency.
        Built Code to reuse port (DONE)
        case 1: Single Node Update (Start:2:35)
        (clean up LOGs)
        case 2: 2 node concurrency resolution
        case 3: 3 node with 2 node concurrency
        case 4: pending accept Pipeline

    b) Client Side consistency
        Server either responds with OK or DB is Inconsistent.
        Server does not corrective actions.


Some important commands
a) Run this first to install run time dependecies to lib
        mvn dependency:copy-dependencies -DoutputDirectory=lib
b) Cassandra first node
   create keyspace
        CREATE KEYSPACE Excelsior
          WITH REPLICATION = { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 3 };
c) running server with args1
      ant run-server -Dnode_id=1
      ${#process}
