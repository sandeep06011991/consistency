Prove the eventual consistency properties of Cassandra

1) If keyspace has a replication factor of 1 and nodes are 2.
Both the nodes have to be up for any read/write .

2) If keyspace has a replication factor of 2 .

    a) start node1 and node2
    a) Kill node1
    b) write to node2
    c) kill node2
    d) restart node1
    e) Check for stale data
    f) restart node2
    h) Wait for the update to propogate via gossip protocols.

This exercise proves the eventual consistency properties.
